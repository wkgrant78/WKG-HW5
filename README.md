### WKG-HW5 - Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


### CRITERIA

* open the planner
* current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and  
  presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present
  or future
* click in a timeblock and can enter an event
* click save and the text for that event is saved in local storage
* saved events persist when page is refreshed


### DEVELOPMENTS/COMMITS

* created intial repo, html, css, and README
* created calendar container, started to develop js
* continued working on js, everything working except timebock color change; created pseudo code to help debug 
* continued color change debugging - still not working
* updated html & css according to js changes
* deleted excess code in js
* final push to repo - color change still not working

### IMPROVEMENTS/QUESTIONS:

* need to work on organization - I was getting confused with all the changes made trying to get color change to work
* need to push more frequently to track changes
* know I need to convert the string "time" to be compared to moment().format in order to get timeblock to change color, not sure how to do that


### REQUIREMENTS:

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

### REQUIRED URLs:
